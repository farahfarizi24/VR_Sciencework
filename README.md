# Virtual Reality Supermarket Experience

This application is built to assess children's (age 5-12 years old) behaviour in selecting cereal goods in a supermarket. Software is deployable in Meta Quest 1, 2, 3, and Pro devices, and will require two controllers to operate.

## Software Overview
* The software begins with character selection and UID selection. Ensure that the character and UID displayed on the mirror match your choices before pressing the left trigger to proceed.
* Users can clench and unclench their virtual hands. Grabbing a cereal object is possible by performing this action while in contact with the object.
* (During data collection) Users receive verbal instructions to select a cereal they want to eat and place it on the cashier's table.
* (During data collection) Users are also verbally instructed to choose a healthy cereal and place it on the cashier's table.
* Verbal instructions are used because the application is deployed in a noisy environment, reducing reliance on the softwareâ€™s speaker. Additionally, some children may be too young to read.
* Collected data can be found in a CSV file in the project system folder of the oculus device Android > data > com.DefaultCompany.VR_Sciencework > files
* Data collected: UID, date, object grabbed, time of grab, time of release, whether the object is the first purchase, and whether the object is the second purchase.

## Input System
* **Right trigger**: Switch character during selection; grabbing objects with right hand (cereal boxes)
* **Left trigger**: Finalise character + user ID; grabbing objects with left hand (cereal boxes)
*  **A button**: decrease UID by 1
*  **B button**: increase UID by 10
